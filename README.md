Reanalysis of chinstrap penguin population trends in the Antarctic Peninsula (reanalysis of Krüger 2023 Diversity 2023, 15, 327)


**Abstract**

Historical data on chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) breeding population sizes are sparse and sometimes highly uncertain, making it hard to estimate true population trajectories. Yet, information on population trends is desirable as changes in population size can help inform conservation assessments. Krüger (2023) (Diversity 2023, 15, 327) used chinstrap penguin nest count data to predict breeding colony size trends between 1960 and 2020, to estimate whether the level of population change within three generations exceeded IUCN Red List Criteria for "Vulnerable" populations. Here, we caution that Krüger (2023)’s statistical analyses, intended to form the foundation for drawing valid, evidence-based inferences from sparse data, contain substantial errors that undermine the validity of that paper’s findings. While we do not address all challenges here, we also show through reanalysis that improved statistical modelling can yield better predictions of chinstrap population trends, at least within the range of observed data. Through this case study we aim to (1) show the profound influence that seemingly minor changes in modelling procedures can have on predictions of population trends; (2) help others detect and avoid some of the pitfalls that may be associated with estimating population trends with mixed models; and (3) highlight the substantial inherent uncertainty in population trend predictions derived from sparse, heterogenous data.
